# Resume Configuration
# =====================
#
# Option 1: Using Google Drive File ID
# Get the file ID from your Google Drive share link:
# https://drive.google.com/file/d/[FILE_ID]/view
# Then set it here:
RESUME_GOOGLE_DRIVE_ID=

# Option 2: Using a Direct URL
# If you have a direct downloadable URL to your resume JSON:
RESUME_URL=

# Note: RESUME_GOOGLE_DRIVE_ID takes precedence if both are set
# The fetch-resume.js script runs before build and downloads the resume
# If both are empty, the fallback resume (resume-fallback.json) will be used
